# AWS-CloudFormation
This is a personal AWS project where I deployed a basic cloud infrastructure using a CloudFormation YAML template. The setup included a VPC, a Bastion Host EC2 instance, RDS with both Writer and Reader instances, SNS, SQS, and SES. I also implemented Lambda functions to integrate these servicesâ€”specifically, triggering SES through SNS (via Lambda) to send notifications generated from RDS events.
